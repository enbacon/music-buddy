# Development Process and Problem Solving
The idea for this project came to me about 6 years ago when I was applying to graduate schools for my Master's in Cello Performance. Preparing for auditions, keeping track of the repertoire, the dates, etc. was so exhausting that I would lose hours to double checking my repertoire, performances, dates, and requirements. I wished that one day I or someone would be able to create a program that would help with the process. Now, after 11 weeks of training, I have built the essentials (plus some) of the dream project, and it can help me, my students, my friends, colleagues, and other musicians, better organize and track their repertoire and performing schedules.

### Difficulties Faced
* Radio buttons.
  - Handling the way they
* Date & Times
  - Formating dates and times to be most helpful and attractive to the user.
* Edit capabilities.
  - Getting the Edit Piece and the Edit Performances pages to be pre-populated with the information already stored was a challenge.
    - The biggest part of the challenge seemed to be switching between the data formats the user would see and the data formats required by the server.
* Getting the user's timezone and offsetting it to make sure the dates were accurate.

## Goals for Future Versions and Unsolved Issues
### Goals
* Allow user to add the movements pieces.
* Allow user to add length of piece to the pieces.
* Have the performance display the length of the performance including intermission.
* Add the ability to mark a performance as 'past' or 'completed.'
* Add the ability to click a button for a printable version of a performance's information.
* Sort pieces by composer's last name.
* Sort pieces by type (i.e. Concerto, Sonata, Suite, etc.)
* Send performance dates to iCal, Google Calendars, etc.
* Have the ability to send the 'printable version' to friends via e-mail.
